# Basic-Shell
* Created a basic Linux Shell as a means to explore some of the more advanced features in C
* Allows for use of any native Linux commands available in a regular Terminal
  * Commands may take advantage of piping fitting user needs
    * Internal commands are filtered out if attempting to pipe them
* New instances of the Shell, or other external programs may be launched using forking
* A Circular Queue data-structure is implemented as a means to save previously entered commands
* Shell may be terminated with an "exit" command, or via Control-C keypress
